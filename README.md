- 👋 Hi, I’m @RachTheRad
- 👀 I’m interested in data that demonstrates a client's relationship with a business or service.
- 🌱 I’m currently Python, Pandas, SQL, and Tableau (but we're always learning).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analytic projects centered on customer service and relationships.
- 📫 How to reach me: rmradwanski@gmail.com; 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: In another life I worked as a pastry cook, and even met Chef Wolfgang Puck while working at one of his restaurants. He demanded the raspberry souffle needed to look like the mountains on which the guests were skiing.
